Summary from session 1

- I discussed the application and how we use Rabbit MQ
- I demonstrtated how I test that everything is getting wired up correctly.
- I refactored the code on-the-fly, as I came up with improvements.
- I put the application into a docker-compose file and proved that all worked.
- I installed minikube and had started playing around with it.
- I ran Kompose to generate K8S yaml files.

The goals for session 2 are

- Get a k8s cluster running locally - DONE. (Started with minikube, switched to docker for desktop.)
- Deploy my application to that cluster and prove that it works
- Deploy my application to an instance of Azure K8S Service (AKS) and prove that it works
- Add Azure Service Bus?


Producer --> RabbitMQ --> Consumer


Code Locally --> Push to git repo --> Publish docker image --> Azure Docker Registry --> Deploy image(s) to K8S



Use minikube docker daemon and registry:
>@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minikube -p minikube docker-env') DO @%i


Possibly uninstall minikube to avoid any conflicts in the future.
